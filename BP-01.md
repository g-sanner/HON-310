## Discovering Open Source
### What is open source?
Open source refers to a product, usually software, where the source code is made publically available for inspection, modification, and redistribution.

Platforms like GitHub make it possible for people all over the world, regardless of location or timezone, to work on the same software project. 

### What surprised me?
As a computer science major, I was already familiar with open source software prior to this class-- its definition, community-driven development,
and tools such as Git and Markdown. When I explored more deeply into the topic, I learned more about the strategic
reasoning behind big tech companies using open source.

React is an open source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By releasing React as open source, Facebook was able to secure React's place
as the standard for front-end applications. As React got more and more popular, developers began to learn it at an increased pace.
This meant that Facebook could hire new developers already familiar with React, so the company did not have to spend money on training
these new hires.

### Which well-known companies and projects use open source?
1. Google
   - TensorFlow - a widely used open-source machine learning library.
   - Chromium â€“ the foundation for Google Chrome.

2. Microsoft
   - Visual Studio Code - a free, open source code editor
   - TypeScript - another open source prohramming language

3. Meta (formerly Facebook)
   - React - part of the example above
   - Also contributes to PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework

### Why does that matter?
It matters which companies use open source for multiple reasons.
1. Innovation Ability
   - Making a project open source opens it to contributions from a large population of developers worldwide. Collaboration on this scale drives much quicker innovation and problem-solving. 
2. Transparency
   - Since the source code is public, users are able to easily inspect it for data privacy practices and security flaws.
3. Sustainability
   - Having open source code creates a community around the company by encouraging good relationships with developers. Because of this community, the software is kept alive and relevant, even without input from the original maintainers.
