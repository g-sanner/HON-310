## GitHub and Markdown
### What I learned about Markdown and Git and how they help me contribute to open source and improve professionally:
This week, I explored the "Intro to Git" and "Intro to GitHub" units of Microsoft's Learning Labs. While I was already familiar with both of these topics, revisiting the basics helped remind me of best practices. I also refreshed my knowledge on branching, committing, and creating and merging pull requests.

These topics will help me improve professionally by allowing me to: 
- collaborate with people around the world, regardless of timezone
- showcase GitHub activity to potential employers

### Have you used them before?
Yes, I have used both GitHub and Markdown extensively in the past. My internship at [Ticomix](https://www.ticomix.com/) used Markdown wikis to track the technical specifications of each project, alongside other things.

### What surprised you about Markdown or Git?
I was surprised by the "rebasing" feature I learned about in the [GitGud](https://www.gitmastery.me/) activity. I had never encountered this feature before and it was interesting to learn the differences between merging and rebasing. 

| Rebasing          | Merging           |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Commits by merging each commit into the main brain one by one    | Commits by combining all changes into one commit and then merging   |
| Merge conflicts may crop up for each individual commit    | Merge conflicts are presented and resolved at the same time     |
| Effective when concerning private projects to help organize history    | Helpful in collaborative projects so that the many commits do not disturb others  |
