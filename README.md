# Welcome!

This is where I am storing the work I completed for my Honors Seminar in Fall 2025 at NIU, known as 'Open Source Collaborating Beyond Code'.

<u>Course Description</u>
This course is designed for individuals interested in learning how to contribute to open source projects.
Participants will develop technical skills, including Git and GitHub workflows, and explore non-code
contributions such as improving documentation and translations. The course combines hands-on
activities, group discussions, reflective blogging, and professional development opportunities. By the
end, participants will have made meaningful contributions to open source projects, built a professional
portfolio, and practiced job-seeking skills
